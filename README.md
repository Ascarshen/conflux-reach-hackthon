[Conflux](https://confluxnetwork.org/) Network originated from the research lab of Turing Award recipient Dr. Andrew Yao at Tsinghua University.
This progressive research provides a solution to the ‘blockchain trilemma’ problem with a novel Tree-Graph consensus mechanism that optimizes security, scalability and decentralization.


[Reach](https://reach.tech) is a new programming language enabling real world development on blockchain through simple and fast enablement tools. DApps to be easily built in a matter of days instead of months. The team has been busy developing tutorials and running workshops for their community members to teach existing and prospective web3 developers how to build their next DApp using Reach.
